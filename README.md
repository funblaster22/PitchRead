**[Check out the live site!](https://funblaster22.github.io/PitchRead/)**

Practice sightreading by actually playing your instrument! Uses the Svelte framework, so see inside any `.svelte` files for documentation comments.

### Running
If on Linux or Mac, run the START.sh file with `bash START.sh`

If on Windows or the script doesn't work you need to [install `nodejs` for Linux](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#installation-instructions).
Then, install npm packages with `npm install` and finally run `npm start`. View the webpage at `localhost:3000`.
